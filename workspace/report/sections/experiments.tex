This section summarizes how the experiments were conducted and their results.

\subsection{Methodology} \label{subsec:methodology}
Experiments were performed using the script \verb|jacobirun.sh|, as better explained in sub-section~\ref{subsec:runningexperiments}.
Specifically each variant of the program (i.e.\ sequential, thread and FastFlow versions) were run both on Xeon CPU and Xeon Phi co-processor for four different system sizes $N$, i.e.\ $5000$, $10000$, $15000$, and $30000$.
Bigger $N$s filled up the memory of the co-processor, hence were not included in the analysis.

\subsection{Results} \label{subsec:results}
