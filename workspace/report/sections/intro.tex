The aim of this project was to produce a program to solve linear systems using the Jacobi method.

Three different implementations are proposed here:
\begin{description}
    \item[Sequential implementation] the sequential implementation provides a \\    
    vanilla implementation of the Jacobi method,
    \item[Thread implementation] is a n\"ive implementation of the algorithm using \lstinline+thread+s from \lstinline|C++11| standard,  
    \item[FastFlow implementation] is an implementation using the \lstinline+parallelFor+ from FastFlow library.
\end{description}

Tests were conducted on a machine using a \emph{Intel Xeon E2650} CPU ($8$ cores clocked at $2$~\si{\giga\hertz} each with $2$ contexts) and a \emph{Intel Xeon Phi} co-processor ($60$ cores clocked at $1$~\si{\giga\hertz} each with $4$ contexts).

\paragraph{Summary.} The next section discusses the details of program design, including theoretical analysis of the expected performance of the parallel implementation.
In Section~\ref{sec:implementation} reports details about the implementation, discussing main aspects of the code and its optimization.
Section~\ref{sec:experiments} is divided in two sub-sections. 
The first sub-section discusses the methodology for the experiments and chosen parameters, while the second sub-section reports the experimental results in the form of tables and graphs.
Section~\ref{sec:guide} includes the user manual for the program, and indications on how to reproduce results reported here.
Finally Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} compares obtained results against the expected ones.
